    <h1 style="text-align:center;">SDOH Barriers for individuals with Genetic Disorders</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Background Information & Key Terms</h2>
       <p>
         <ul>
  <li>SDOH</li>
  <li>Health Equity</li>
  <li>Genetic Disorders</li>
  <li>Chromosome</li>
  <li>Gene</li>
  <li>Types of Genetic Disorders</li>
          </ul>
       </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Challenges & SDOH Barriers</h3>
       <p>SDOH barriers are one of the biggest reasons why individuals with genetic disorders face more challenges than an average person. Some of these challenges include the following:
          <ul>
  <li>Increases in health problems</li>
  <li>Need for specialized care, frequent hospitalization</li>
  <li>Higher healthcare costs</li>
  <li>Death at younger ages</li>
          </ul>

All of these challenges and many more are caused by SDOH barriers that individuals with genetic disorders face, in society/community, the healthcare system, and many others. These SDOH barriers can affect many things, including the following:
    <ul>
  <li>Access to required healthcare</li>
  <li>Success in academics/career & holding their occupations</li>
  <li>Assistance & support from community, family, etc.</li>
  <li>Living in risk-free areas (Health & safety)</li>
    </ul>

These challenges and SDOH barriers are also obstacles towards reaching health equity for individuals with genetic disorders. Without health equity, the lives of these individuals with genetic disorders can be severely affected. Their lives may have reduced length and quality because of an increased rate of disease severity, disability, and death. Health equity is necessary for all individuals, whether they have genetic disorders or not, to enjoy their lives and live healthily.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Effects of SDOH Barriers</h3>
       <p>Figure 1: This image shows a pie chart of the 4 major SDOHs and the percentage of effect on an individual. The chart shows that socioeconomic factors, such as education, income, and community influence 40% of an individual’s health. This statistic is significant because it shows that severe changes to these factors can lead to severe changes to an individual’s health. Health Behaviors are the second-most influential, at 30%, with behaviors such as diet and exercise. These factors are important because they are the main factors behind a person’s metabolism, along with other smaller factors that can affect vital organs, such as the lungs and liver. Finally, the access and quality of healthcare comes in at 20%, while the physical environmental conditions comes in at least-influential at 10%. Overall, this data shows the major factors in each SDOH that are the most influential on an individual’s health.<br></br>

Figure 2: This image shows a feedback loop, specifically about the effects of SDOH barriers on an individual with a genetic disorder. A description of the variables involved with each assigned number is given below. 
        <ol>
  <li>This feedback loop is centered around an individual and their life. This individual has a genetic disorder and it causes a strong, negative effect on the individual’s health. The other variables are connected to each other, eventually affecting the individual. Yellow, Orange, and Red variables are progressively worse for the individual, while blue and purple variables are progressively better. </li>
  <li>This variable is a constant and is blue. “Family Support” falls under the Social and Community Context SDOH and is a constant in the individual’s life. It decreases variables such as “Stress”, “Discrimination”, and “Lack of Money”. Support from family members can be helpful in all three situations. They can provide an individual with protection from discrimination in society, advice for difficult and stressful situations, and in some cases, financial support when the individual is struggling.</li>
  <li>This chain of variables starts with another constant, however, this has a negative effect on the individual. For some reasons, the individual was unable to receive a proper education. This increases the chances of unemployment, which increases the amount of money the individual has. The “Lack of Money” variable can increase stress in an individual’s life, as they struggle to meet living requirements. In addition, a lack of money can also lead to a lack of access to healthcare, or a lack of good quality healthcare, which is detrimental to the individual’s life.</li>
   <li>As said previously, a lack of healthcare or quality healthcare is detrimental for the individual’s life. This variable “increases” the “Genetic Disorder” variable, meaning that it increases the chances of the disorder becoming more severe because of the lack of needed care. A lack of access to healthcare also decreases the quality of society.</li>
   <li>Another constant in the individual’s life is a healthy and safe environment. This increases the quality of society, as well as the food quality and quality/amount of friends. This is a positive variable for the individual’s health because nutrition from food is a basic life necessity. A good society increases the likelihood of a good environment and vice versa. A good society increases proactiveness, meaning that there are more reforms being made. This proactiveness can increase access to healthcare, which is necessary for the individual. A good society also leads to good housing conditions, yet another basic life necessity. These variables have the strongest influence on the individual’s life, as seen in this feedback loop and in Figure 1.</li>
  <li>As previously mentioned, the “Discrimination” variable is present in the individual’s life, which increases a lack in confidence. This leads to an increase in isolation and stress, eventually coming back to increasing the severity of the genetic disorder. (Excess amounts of stress can lead to changes in gene expression, affecting an individual’s physical characteristics.) However, a positive variable such as “Friends” can decrease discrimination, a lack of confidence, and isolation, once again positively affecting the individual’s life. The variable “Friends” also stems from a good environment.</li>
    <li>In this last, but most important variable, the severity of the individual's genetic disorder is highly impacted. The “Stress” variable directly affects the “Genetic Disorder” variable because it is able to cause destructive changes to the individual, as mentioned in #6. Stress is one of the only common factors between all individuals around the world. Whether it has a large or small influence on an individual’s life, when unattended to, it can lead to life-changing injuries, physically, mentally, and/or emotionally.</li>

This feedback loop is just one model showing the direct effects of SDOH barriers on an individual with a genetic disorder. Without large and influential changes to systems such as society and healthcare, it will become extremely difficult for individuals with genetic disorders, and individuals overall, to reach health equity.
     </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Improvements & Actions</h3>
        <p>While SDOH barriers are causing severe challenges for individuals with genetic disorders, there is still hope. Organizations such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have smaller offices and groups that are reducing health inequalities for individuals with genetic disorders. One example is CDC’s Office of Genomics and Precision Public Health (OGPPH), which is taking big steps to improve living conditions and health equity. Some of these actions include the following:
          <ul>
  <li>Increasing awareness of individuals to prevent/identify genetic diseases early</li>
  <li>Using genomic tests & family health records to identify genetic diseases</li>
  <li>Increasing awareness of genetic disorders using media</li>
    </ul>
  
With organizations and offices such as CDC and OGPPH, reaching health equity for all individuals seems like a feasible and viable goal for the world.
